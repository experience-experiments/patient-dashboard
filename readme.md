# Patient Dashboard App

This is the source code repository for the Patient Dashboard App. 

This repository is organised as a multi-module repo. Each individual component of the application is located in their own project folders.

Currently `server` for the express/socket.io server and `web-ui` for the webpack project that produces the web application interface.

Each project folder contains source code and build scripts to enable individual project development tasks.

Each project folder will have their own descriptors e.g. `package.json`, `pom.xml` etc.

## Installing the dependencies

Go into each individual process and install dependencies if at any point you'd like to run them locally in your host machine.

E.g.

```
cd server && npm install && cd .. 
cd web-ui && npm install && cd .. 
```
